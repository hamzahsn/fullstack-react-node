## Introduction

[WIP] This is a starter project that use Typescript for React for client and Nodejs for server bundled with webpack and using Mongodb as a database, which simplify developer's life whom wants to developer a client/server project with these technologies and which also I'm trying to implement the best practices for both clients and server
